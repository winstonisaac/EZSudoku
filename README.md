# EZSudoku
EZSudoku is a Sudoku solver. It is currently a work in progress.

## What is Sudoku?
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku))

## Feature List
* The current build can solve up to [the hardest puzzles](http://www.mathsphere.co.uk/downloads/sudoku/10204-fiendish.pdf).
* Designed to work for perfect square Sudokus (tested up to a 16 x 16 puzzle).

## Special Thanks
